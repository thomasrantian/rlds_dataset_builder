End-to-end learning has shown promise in various tasks, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Recently, rapid progress has also been made in end-to-end robot learning for both high-level planning and low-level control. Central to these astonishing achievements is the foundation of substantial training data in the field of robot learning. We proudly unveil a comprehensive dataset, encompassing over 400 instances of robot demonstrations executed on intricate manipulation tasks. We hope this data set can help advance future robot learning research.
